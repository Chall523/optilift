# OptiLift

This final project, titled OptiLift, was an idea spurred from my interest in fitness and nutrition, that I intended to use data from different applications of my own journey. Thus, the project was conceived with the goal of developing a comprehensive tool that integrates weightlifting data and dietary intake to provide personalized recommendations that enhance strength training results. This project focuses on the interplay between nutrition and exercise, aiming to optimize physical performance through data-driven insights. OptiLift is structured around many different Python modules and packages that leverage data processing, statistical analysis, and visualizations to offer users actionable feedback on their fitness journey.

Computation forms the backbone of my project, where substantial arithmetic operations and data fitting techniques are employed. Initial tasks include processing raw data inputs through functions like loadWorkout and loadDietary, which handle Excel files and convert date formats using pandas. This ensures accurate alignment for time-series analyses. Further computations are seen in the processWorkout function, where the workout volume is calculated by multiplying sets, reps, and weights. These operations are pivotal for setting the stage for more detailed analysis. Additionally, predictive modeling through linear regression, as implemented in the predictPerformance function, showcases the application's capacity for machine learning, predicting workout volumes based on dietary caloric intake.

Statistics play a vital role in validating and exploring the effects of dietary inputs on workout outputs. The project utilizes correlation analysis in the correlateDietToWorkout function to identify key relationships between nutritional factors and workout performance, helping pinpoint which dietary elements most significantly impact physical outputs. Moreover, statistical testing through t-tests in the dietEffectiveness function assesses the impact of dietary changes on workout volume, using hypothesis testing to confirm whether dietary modifications significantly affect workout outcomes. These statistical methods ensure that conclusions drawn from the app are not only based on observational data but are also statistically significant.

Visualization enhances user interaction and understanding, transforming complex data sets into intuitive graphical formats that facilitate easy comprehension of trends and patterns. Heatmaps in OptiLift display correlation matrices with enhanced annotations and color mapping, making them more readable and informative. Customized scatter plots with regression lines further illustrate how variables such as caloric intake relate to workout intensity, helping users visually digest how changes in diet might influence their performance. Additionally, progress and forecasting charts plot users’ performance over time and predict future achievements, aiding in goal setting and adjustments.
Finally, everything was assembled with a graphical user interface (GUI), built with Tkinter, and this makes it easy for users to interact with the program and was also one of my favorite parts when it finally popped up onto my screen. The GUI simplifies the process of uploading workout and dietary data, selecting different analyses, and viewing the results through clear graphs and charts. This setup, with prompts and dialog boxes, helps all users, regardless of their technical skills, to easily access and understand complex data. By combining all the app's features into a simple, easy-to-use interface, the GUI plays a key role in helping users make informed decisions about their fitness and health. 

The following are each of my functions and how they tie into the main idea of my project. 
The functions loadWorkout and loadDietary serve as essential tools for loading workout and dietary data from Excel files, ensuring that dates are formatted correctly. Their accurate loading and formatting lay the groundwork for all subsequent data handling, ensuring the datasets are primed for thorough analysis. processWorkout and processDietary further enrich these datasets by calculating additional metrics such as total workout volume and calorie categories. These enhancements allow for a more nuanced exploration of the interactions between exercise routines and dietary habits. The function correlateDietToWorkout is crucial for determining the relationships between dietary metrics and workout volumes, pinpointing which dietary factors have the most significant impact on workout performance. This analysis helps provide evidence-based recommendations for dietary adjustments to optimize physical output. predictPerformance utilizes linear regression to forecast future workout performance based on current dietary data. This predictive approach offers forward-looking insights, helping users understand potential future changes in workout outcomes based on their dietary habits. The dietEffectiveness function assesses the impact of dietary changes on workout performance using statistical methods like t-tests. This rigorous analysis confirms the effectiveness of dietary interventions, providing a strong statistical foundation for dietary advice. ProcessDietaryChange allows for the comparison of workout and dietary data before and after a specified date, analyzing the direct effects of dietary changes on physical performance. This function is key to understanding the real-time impact of dietary adjustments. AlignDataforNutrition ensures that dietary data is accurately aligned with corresponding workout data, adjusting dates to account for the delayed effects of nutrition on physical performance. This alignment is critical for accurately reflecting the impact of diet on workout outcomes. standardize_weights standardizes weight measurements across various exercises, allowing for fair comparisons and more meaningful analysis across diverse workout data. This standardization is essential for evaluating relative effort and progress in strength training across different exercises. nutritionAnalysis performs regression analysis to link macronutrient intake with specific exercise performances, offering detailed insights into how various nutrients affect physical capabilities. This function enables targeted nutritional recommendations that can enhance specific aspects of workout performance. MacroDist visualizes the distribution of macronutrients over selected dates or average intakes, helping users understand their nutritional balance and make informed adjustments to their diets based on visual data representations. gains tracks and plots strength gains over time for specific exercises, providing motivational visual feedback on progress. exerciseProgress displays progress towards exercise-specific goals in a bar graph format, offering users a clear visual indication of how close they are to achieving their fitness targets. heatmap generates a heatmap to visually represent the correlation matrix between dietary and workout variables, providing an intuitive overview of how different dietary factors interact with workout metrics. forecastLift predicts future performance for specific exercises based on historical data trends, aiding users in setting realistic goals and expectations for future strength gains. launch_main_window initiates the main GUI window of the application, integrating all functionalities into a user-friendly interface that acts as the gateway to the application’s extensive capabilities. upload_data simplifies the initial data uploading process through the GUI, ensuring that workout and dietary data are correctly integrated into the system for detailed analysis. run_analysis and run_visualization are pivotal in bringing analytical and visual capabilities to the user based on user input.

In creating the OptiLift project, we made some basic assumptions to keep things straightforward. One major assumption is that everyone responds the same way to changes in diet, which doesn't take into account personal differences like how fast someone's body processes food or their fitness level. This could make the results less applicable to everyone. We also assume that the data users enter about their diets and workouts is accurate. However, users might not always enter their information correctly, either by mistake or because they don’t remember exactly which is what happened with me often. This could lead to errors in our analysis since we're relying on this data to be true and consistent. Also, nutrition data was from MyFitnessPal which does not retain the exact macronutrients. Lastly, we’ve assumed that the relationship between what users eat and their workout results can be understood with simple linear patterns. This approach doesn't capture more complex behaviors that might show up in real-life scenarios and other factors that are not included in the analysis. 

OptiLift has provided insightful results, demonstrating the significant impact of integrating dietary and workout data on fitness outcomes. Our analysis found a positive correlation between protein intake and workout volume, suggesting that increased protein consumption can enhance exercise intensity. This relationship is clearly illustrated in our heatmap visualization. Additionally, our predictive performance analysis showed that caloric intake could effectively predict workout volume, indicating that higher calorie intake leads to more intense workouts. This is visually supported by scatter plots with regression lines, which display a clear predictive accuracy. Our diet effectiveness analysis further confirmed significant improvements in workout performance following dietary adjustments, particularly with increased protein and calorie intake. Bar charts visualizing these changes highlight noticeable gains in workout intensity.,Finally, strength gains over time analysis showed consistent improvement among users adhering to dietary recommendations, with line graphs demonstrating upward trends in strength for key exercises. These findings validate OptiLift's core ideas and underscore the value of tailored dietary recommendations, with visualizations providing an intuitive understanding of the data, empowering users to optimize their fitness strategies effectively. Throughout the development of OptiLift, I encountered several challenges that led to changes in our approach and provided valuable learning opportunities. One significant issue was the learning curve associated with the GUIs using Tkinter. As someone relatively new to GUI development, navigating the complexities of creating an intuitive and user-friendly interface required considerable effort and experimentation. This challenge often slowed progress and led to frequent revisions of the interface design to ensure it met user needs effectively. Also, I wanted to make the bland look a little more aesthetically pleasing and so I spent some time on that as well. Additionally, we faced difficulties with data consistency and accuracy, as the project relied heavily on user-reported data. This variability sometimes led to anomalies in the analysis, prompting us to implement more robust data validation and cleaning processes to improve data reliability and analysis outcomes. I had to ensure that the transfer of data from different sources went smoothly. This was all my doing and from my own gym log and thankfully, consistent, journaling. I had a compound exercise almost every day (some days off), but otherwise this allowed me to have enough data for reasonable analysis. Also, the nutrition data was not always the cleanest because it was estimated and not exact, but this would mostly not change the overall results. 
Looking forward, there are several exciting avenues to expand this OptiLift project, hopefully over the summer. One potential area for development is integrating more complex machine learning algorithms to enhance predictive accuracy and provide more personalized recommendations. Another expansion could be the addition of features that track micronutrients and their effects on workout recovery and performance. This would offer users deeper insights into how vitamins and minerals, not just macronutrients, affect their fitness progress. Or the addition of other aspects of fitness, such as cardiovascular and how this ties in with fitness. Also, I only used compound lifts which do not show the entire workout session and I hope to involve more data for other exercises as well. Furthermore, developing a mobile application of OptiLift could significantly increase its accessibility, allowing users to update their data in real-time and receive instant feedback on their nutrition and workout routines directly from their phones.
